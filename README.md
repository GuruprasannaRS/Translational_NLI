# Translational_NLI

Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a crucial
task in natural language processing, involving
the determination of the logical relationship between
two given statements - a premise and a
hypothesis. In this context, the FEVER dataset,
initially designed for Fact Extraction and Verification
tasks, serves as a valuable resource
for NLI-based research. The dataset consists
of pairs of premises and hypotheses in English,
which are then translated into French for multilingual
evaluation. These pairs are annotated
with labels indicating whether the statements
exhibit an entailment, contradiction, or neutral
relationship. This project explores the application
of NLI models in a multilingual setting
by evaluating the performance of translated
English premise and hypothesis pairs. The
project uses state-of-the-art machine translation
techniques to convert English pairs into
French. The translated French pairs undergo
an NLI classification task to predict logical relationships
between the statements.The NLI
classifications of the translated pairs are compared
with actual French premise and hypothesis
pairs to assess the accuracy and reliability of
the machine translation process. Through this
comprehensive evaluation, valuable insights
are gained into the cross-lingual transferability
of NLI models, as they encounter diverse
linguistic contexts. Ensuring the quality of the
translation process is crucial in preserving the
integrity of the NLI task outcomes. The outcomes
of this study significantly contribute to
the advancement of multilingual NLI research,
guiding the development of robust NLI models
capable of effectively handling multiple languages.
Moreover, the projectâ€™s insights have
practical implications in various applications,
such as cross-lingual information retrieval and
automated fact-checking, enabling more sophisticated
understanding and processing of multilingual
data in real-world scenarios.
